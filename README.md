# Hi, I’m Drew 👋  
**Machine Learning Engineer | High-Performance Systems | C++/CUDA | Computer Vision | ML Infrastructure**

I build **real-time, performance-critical systems** at the intersection of **computer vision, GPU acceleration, robotics simulation, and ML infrastructure.**  
My background spans **AI/ML, optimization, deep learning, GPU programming, and systems-level engineering**, with a Master’s degree in **AI & Machine Learning from Columbia University**.

I'm currently focused on:
- **Modern C++ (C++17/20)** for vision, tracking, and real-time pipelines  
- **CUDA kernel optimization** and GPU acceleration  
- **Inference runtime systems** (batching, streaming, KV-cache simulation)  
- **Orchestrated ML pipelines** (Airflow/Prefect, MLflow, Ray)  
- **Distributed GPU workloads on Kubernetes**  
- **Simulation and autonomous robotics**
